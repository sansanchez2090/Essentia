# 🧪 Workshop 1 – Project Definition and Planning  
**Software Engineering Seminar**

---

## 📌 Overview
This folder contains the deliverables for **Workshop 1** of the Software Engineering Seminar course.  
The goal of this workshop is to define the business context, value proposition, user requirements,  
and initial planning artifacts for our project: **Essentia**, a lightweight microservices-based  
perfume management platform focused on CRUD operations and RESTful API design.

## 1️⃣ Business Model Canvas
The **Business Model Canvas (BMC)** provides a strategic overview of the project,  
highlighting key partners, activities, resources, customer segments, and value propositions.  
It serves as the foundation for understanding the business logic behind Essentia.

## 2️⃣ User Stories
This section presents the **user stories** for the main roles in the system (admin, user, and manager),  
describing how they interact with the platform and what outcomes they expect.  
Each story follows the standard format and includes **acceptance criteria** for clarity and testability.

## 3️⃣ User Story Mapping
The **User Story Map** organizes and prioritizes user stories, showing how the platform’s features  
are structured across different development stages and user goals.

## 4️⃣ CRC Cards
The **Class-Responsibility-Collaborator (CRC) Cards** define the main classes of the system,  
their core responsibilities, and their relationships with other components — serving as an  
initial step toward the object-oriented design of Essentia.
