# 📚 Essentia Documentation

Welcome to the **documentation space** of **Essentia**, a lightweight web platform for managing perfume collections through basic CRUD operations. This folder contains all project-related documents, workshops, planning artifacts, and technical references that support the development and evolution of the system.

---

## 📁 Structure

The documentation is organized as follows:

- **Workshop-1/** – Project definition and planning artifacts (Business Model Canvas, User Stories, etc.)

---

## 🐳 Docker Integration

Essentia uses **Docker** to simplify deployment and ensure consistency across development environments.  
Containerization will allow each microservice — the **Java database service** and the **Python REST API service** — to run independently and communicate through a networked environment.

You will find:
- `Dockerfile` examples for both services.
- A `docker-compose.yml` file for orchestrating the entire application stack.
- Environment setup instructions and tips for local deployment.

---

## 🧭 Purpose

This folder is designed to:
- Centralize all documentation in one place.
- Support the Software Engineering Seminar workshops.
- Provide reference material for developers, testers, and collaborators.
- Track the evolution of the project from planning to implementation.
