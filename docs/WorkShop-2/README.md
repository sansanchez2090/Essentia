## üìå Overview
This workshop corresponds to the **design phase** of the *Software Engineering Seminar* course project.  
It focuses on creating the main **design artifacts** that define the system‚Äôs logical structure, internal components, and early interface design for the project **Essentia** ‚Äî a microservices-based web platform for managing and exploring perfumes.

The deliverables in this workshop clarify the system‚Äôs structure, guide implementation, and demonstrate progress in the project‚Äôs development.

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Class Diagrams
The **UML Class Diagrams** describe the main entities and their relationships, defining how objects interact within the system.  
They serve as the foundation for database modeling and backend logic design.

---

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Architecture Diagram
The **Software Architecture Diagram** provides a high-level view of the system, illustrating its layers, microservices, and data flow.  
It highlights the interaction between the frontend, backend, databases, and external integrations.

---

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Deployment Architecture
This diagram explains how *Essentia* is deployed across environments using **Docker** containers.  
It details how the services, databases, and external tools are distributed and communicate through the CI/CD pipeline.

---

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Business Model Processes
This section documents the project‚Äôs **core business processes** using **BPMN** or **activity diagrams**.  
It defines how users interact with the platform to perform actions such as registration, login, and CRUD operations on perfumes.

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ Web UI Progress
This section presents **mockups or early UI prototypes**, showing the progress made in the web interface design.  
Wireframes and design previews illustrate how users will interact with the system‚Äôs main features.
