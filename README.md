# 🌸 Essentia

Essentia is a lightweight web platform designed to manage a collection of perfumes through simple CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. Built with a **microservices architecture**, it uses a **Java** service for database connection (MySQL) and a **Python** service for RESTful APIs. The project is designed for backend development, API design, and future testing practices — all running seamlessly in containerized environments with **Docker**.
